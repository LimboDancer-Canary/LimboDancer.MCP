# 3. **Cosmos Gremlin graph scaffold**

   * Files: `src/LimboDancer.MCP.Graph.CosmosGremlin/{GremlinClientFactory.cs, GraphStore.cs, Preconditions.cs, Effects.cs}`.
   * Implement upsert of vertices/edges for core classes (Person, Trip, Reservation, Tool/Skill) and helpers to evaluate preconditions/effects.
   * Why: Itâ€™s called out as a core library and feeds the precondition/effect path. &#x20;
